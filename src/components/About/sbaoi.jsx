              Established in 1986 and registered under the Travancore-Cochin Act
              XII of 1955, with the name Society for Biomaterials and Artificial
              Organs-India (SBAOI) to promote Biomedical Technology in India.
              SBAOI stands for cultivating a research atmosphere nationwide for
              the growth of basic studies as well as advanced technology
              development related to Biomaterials and Artificial Organs. Also,
              the Society strives to bring professionals from various faculties
              together to improve the quality of their approach and modalities
              in research. Internationally, SBAOI is a constituent society of
              the International Union of Societies of Biomaterials Science and
              Engineering (IUS-BSE) who coordinate international activities,
              including World Biomaterials Congress. SBAOI have till now
              conducted 33 National Conferences hosted at different National
              Institutes like IITs, IISc and national and state Universities.
              The national conference was also held at the College of Biomedical
              Engineering and Applied Sciences at Kathmandu, Nepal twice. SBAOI
              has been representing the World Biomaterials Congresses since 1996
              at Toronto. SBAOI has various regional chapters namely the Chennai
